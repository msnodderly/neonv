# The Art of Hand-Drip Coffee

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is a balance of science and ritual. This guide covers the V60 method, which highlights the acidity and floral notes of light-roast beans.

## Equipment Needed
- V60 Dripper (Ceramic or Metal)
- Paper Filter
- Gooseneck Kettle (Critical for flow control)
- Scale (Accuracy to 0.1g)
- Freshly roasted beans (Burr ground to medium-fine)

## The Process

### Step 1: Rinsing the Filter
Place the filter in the dripper and pour hot water through it. This removes the paper taste and pre-heats the vessel.

### Step 2: The Bloom
Add 20g of coffee. Pour 40g of water (twice the weight of the coffee) and wait 30 seconds. You'll see bubbles forming; this is CO2 escaping.

### Step 3: The Main Pour
Slowly pour in concentric circles until you reach 300g total weight. The draw-down should finish around the 3:00 minute mark.

## Troubleshooting
| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Too Bitter | Water too hot or grind too fine | Coarsen grind / Lower temp |
| Too Sour | Under-extracted | Finer grind / Slower pour |
| Weak Body | Low coffee-to-water ratio | Try 1:14 instead of 1:15 |

*Enjoy your brew!*
