# Gardening Notes: Spring 2026

The soil is finally warming up. I spent the weekend clearing the winter mulch and prepping the beds.

## Seed Starting Status
| Plant | Variety | Sown Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tomato | Cherokee Purple | March 1 | Sprouted |
| Pepper | Habanada | March 5 | Waiting |
| Kale | Lacinato | Feb 20 | Ready to transplant |

## Observations
The aphids are already back on the roses. I'm going to try a neem oil spray this evening. The compost pile is finally hitting 140 degrees—turning it every three days seems to be the trick.

### Ideas for the Back Fence
- Climbing Jasmine for the scent.
- Maybe some trellis-grown cucumbers?
- Need to fix the irrigation drip line near the blueberries.

### Shopping List (Home Depot)
1. 4 bags of organic potting mix
2. New pruning shears (the old ones are rusted)
3. Marigold starts (for pest control)
4. Cedar planks for the raised bed expansion
