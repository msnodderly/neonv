## NeoNV v0.2.1

Bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- **Preview shows first non-empty line** — Untitled notes now show their first line of content in the file list, instead of "(untitled)"
- **Cleaner search UI** — Removed distracting hover effect from search bar dividers

### Performance

- **Faster folder scanning** — Non-text files are now skipped early during directory enumeration, reducing startup time for folders with many binary files

### Installation

Download the DMG, drag NeoNV to Applications. On first launch, right-click → Open (app is unsigned).
