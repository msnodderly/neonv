## NeoNV v0.2.1

Bug fixes and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- **Preview shows first non-empty line** — Untitled notes now show their first line of content in the file list, instead of "(untitled)"
- **Cleaner search UI** — Removed distracting hover effect from search bar dividers

### Performance

- **Faster folder scanning** — Non-text files are now skipped early during directory enumeration, reducing startup time for folders with many binary files

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
