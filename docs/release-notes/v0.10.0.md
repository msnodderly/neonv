## NeoNV v0.10.0

This release adds tagging support and fixes several edge cases with file extensions and tag synchronization.

### New Features

- **Tagging support** — Press Cmd+Shift+T to add tags to notes. Tags are stored inline in Markdown and org-mode files.
- **Alternate layout shortcut** — Cmd+Ctrl+L now toggles between horizontal and vertical layouts (in addition to existing shortcuts).

### Fixes

- **Unsaved indicator reliability** — The unsaved dot now correctly clears after a note is written to disk.
- **Tag text field sync** — Removing or editing tags in the text field now properly updates the underlying file.
- **Org-mode tag parsing** — Tags in org files are now correctly parsed from the raw content.
- **File extension preservation** — Explicit file extensions (e.g., `.org`) are now preserved when creating or renaming notes.

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (unsigned app):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
