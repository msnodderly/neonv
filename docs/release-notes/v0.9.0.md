## NeoNV v0.9.0

Quality-of-life improvements for file creation and editor stability.

### New Features

- **Subdirectory creation** — Create files with paths like `projects/2026/notes` and NeoNV automatically creates the intermediate directories

### Fixes

- **Editor flickering** — Eliminated text flickering that occurred when typing near the bottom of files by switching to incremental text styling

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (unsigned app):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** in Security section
4. Enter password when prompted
