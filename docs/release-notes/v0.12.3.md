## NeoNV v0.12.3

Fixes a tab focus cycle regression introduced in v0.12.0 where the editor could steal focus from preview mode.

### Fixes

- **Tab focus cycle in preview mode** — The editor no longer intercepts focus when the preview pane is active. Tab/Shift-Tab now cycle correctly between search, file list, and preview without the hidden editor grabbing focus.

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (unsigned app):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** in Security section
4. Enter password when prompted
