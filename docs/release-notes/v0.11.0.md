## NeoNV v0.11.0

Navigation and safety improvements with better error visibility and file handling.

### New Features

- **Mouse back/forward navigation** — Use mouse buttons to navigate note history
- **Per-note cursor memory** — Cursor position is preserved when switching notes
- **First-save collision toast** — Clear feedback when a filename is reassigned
- **Inline file read errors** — Errors are shown directly in the editor
- **Read-only indicator** — Non-writable files display a read-only state
- **Safer deletes** — Notes move to Trash instead of being permanently deleted
- **Toolbar accessibility labels** — Buttons are announced correctly by VoiceOver

### Fixes

- **Forward navigation** — Cmd+] now navigates forward reliably
- **Atomic write safety** — Unique temp filenames prevent corruption
- **Rename watcher correctness** — Internal renames no longer look like deletes
- **Note ID preservation** — Renames keep note identity intact

### Installation

1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
