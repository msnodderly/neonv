## NeoNV v0.8.0

Keyboard shortcut improvements and bug fixes.

### New Features

- **Cmd+Period for Insert Date** — Alternative shortcut for inserting the current date, complementing the existing Cmd+D

### Fixes

- **Cursor positioning on new note** — When creating a note from Cmd+L, the cursor now positions at the end of the text instead of the beginning
- **`@done` strikethrough** — Strikethrough formatting now applies immediately when typing `@done`, fixing a regression

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
