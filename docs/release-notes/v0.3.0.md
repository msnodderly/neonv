## NeoNV v0.3.0

Improved org-mode support with smarter title extraction and cleaner previews.

### New Features

- **Org-mode title extraction** — File list now displays `#+TITLE:` value as the note title instead of raw metadata
- **Clean org-mode previews** — Content previews hide `#+TITLE:`, `#+CATEGORY:`, `#+FILETAGS:`, and other metadata lines for a cleaner reading experience
- **Vertical list content preview** — Vertical layout now shows a content preview below the title/filename

### Fixes

- **Updated installation instructions** — Clarified steps for macOS Sequoia's stricter Gatekeeper prompts

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
