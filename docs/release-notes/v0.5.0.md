## NeoNV v0.5.0

Editor customization and improved markdown preview rendering.

### New Features

- **Font family picker** — Choose your preferred editor font from installed monospace fonts in Settings
- **Markdown table rendering** — Tables in markdown files now render properly in the preview pane

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
