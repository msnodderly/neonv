## NeoNV v0.6.0

Performance improvements and critical editor fixes for a smoother note-taking experience.

### New Features

- **Metadata caching** — First launch now shows your notes instantly (10-30ms warm startup for cached folders)
- **Date shortcuts** — Press Cmd+Shift+D in the Cmd+L file creation field to insert today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Plain text mode** — Disabled automatic text substitutions to preserve exact characters (no more `---` converting to em-dashes)

### Fixes

- **Cloud sync compatibility** — Resolved false "File Changed Externally" notifications when saving to Dropbox/iCloud
- **Editor click behavior** — Fixed cursor placement and scroll instability when clicking in the editor
- **Window restoration** — Cmd-N now properly restores the window after all windows are closed

### Performance

- **Instant startup** — Metadata caching displays your notes immediately on warm starts
- **Background validation** — File changes are validated in the background without blocking the UI

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
