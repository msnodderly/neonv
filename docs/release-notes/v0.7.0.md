## NeoNV v0.7.0

Right-click rename for notes in the file list.

### New Features

- **Right-click Rename** — Rename any note directly from the file list via right-click context menu. Works in both vertical and horizontal layouts. Shows a dialog pre-filled with the current filename, validates for duplicates and empty names, and preserves your selection after renaming.

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (app is unsigned):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS will block it with "NeoNV cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the NeoNV message
5. Enter your password when prompted

After this one-time setup, NeoNV opens normally.
