## NeoNV v0.12.0

Window memory, scroll preservation, and reliability improvements across the board.

### New Features

- **Remember window position and size** — NeoNV restores your window placement across launches
- **Preserve scroll position in preview** — Toggling Cmd+P no longer jumps back to the top

### Fixes

- **Prevent autosave during file load errors** — Autosave no longer fires when a file fails to load, preventing data loss
- **Rename dialog clarity** — The rename dialog now clarifies that the file extension is preserved automatically
- **Suppress search auto-select** — Manual arrow-key navigation in the file list is no longer interrupted by search auto-selection
- **SHA-256 for external change detection** — Replaced non-deterministic String.hashValue with SHA-256 for reliable external change detection
- **Eliminate TOCTOU race in atomicWrite** — File writes are now safe against time-of-check/time-of-use races
- **Restore Cmd+Shift+D date insertion** — Date insertion shortcut works again after the performKeyEquivalent fix
- **Preserve undo history across preview toggles** — Switching between edit and preview no longer clears undo/redo history
