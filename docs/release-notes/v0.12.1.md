## NeoNV v0.12.1

Keyboard focus regression fix for pane navigation.

### Fixes

- **Restore pane Tab cycle after Cmd+L** — Tab now reliably moves from search to file list to editor, and Shift-Tab from editor returns to file list.

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (unsigned app):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** in Security section
4. Enter password when prompted
