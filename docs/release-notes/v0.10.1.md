## NeoNV v0.10.1

Bug fix release that corrects the unsaved indicator display after saving new notes.

### Fixes

- **Unsaved indicator persisted after save** — After saving a new note created with Cmd+N, the "[unsaved]" label remained in the file list even though the note was successfully written to disk. The unsaved indicator now correctly disappears after save.

### Installation

Download the DMG and drag NeoNV to Applications.

**First launch (unsigned app):**
1. Double-click NeoNV — macOS blocks with "cannot be opened"
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** in Security section
4. Enter password when prompted
