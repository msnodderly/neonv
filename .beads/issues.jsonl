{"id":"neonv-0b0","title":"Replace String.hashValue with SHA-256 for external change detection","description":"What: External change detection uses String.hashValue to compare saved content with current disk content. String.hashValue is not collision-resistant — it uses a randomized seed per process and is designed for hash table performance, not content comparison. Two different strings can produce the same hash, causing genuine external modifications to be silently ignored. The user's next save would then overwrite the external change without any conflict dialog.\n\nLocation: NoteStore.swift L196-218\n\nCurrent code:\n```swift\n// L199: saving hash\nlastSavedContentHash[url] = content.hashValue\n\n// L217: comparing\nreturn currentContent.hashValue != savedHash\n```\n\nImpact: If a hash collision occurs, hasContentChangedExternally returns false for genuinely changed content. The external modification is ignored, no conflict dialog is shown, and the user's next autosave silently overwrites the external change.\n\nFix:\n1. Replace String.hashValue with a proper content hash (SHA-256 via CryptoKit):\n```swift\nimport CryptoKit\n\nprivate var lastSavedContentHash: [URL: String] = [:]\n\nfunc markAsSavedLocally(_ url: URL, content: String? = nil) {\n    recentlySavedURLs.insert(url)\n    if let content = content, let data = content.data(using: .utf8) {\n        lastSavedContentHash[url] = SHA256.hash(data: data).map { String(format: \"%02x\", $0) }.joined()\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n```\n2. Update hasContentChangedExternally to compute and compare SHA-256 hashes\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] Content hashing uses SHA-256 (or equivalent cryptographic hash) instead of String.hashValue\n- [ ] External changes are reliably detected regardless of content patterns\n- [ ] No false negatives in external change detection (verified by test if feasible)\n- [ ] Build succeeds: xcodebuild -scheme NeoNV -destination 'platform=macOS' build\n\nContext: Discovered during file safety audit.

{"id":"neonv-caj","title":"Fix autosave writing to wrong file after note selection change","description":"What: scheduleAutoSave fires a 500ms delayed task. Two separate bugs cause data loss when switching notes during this window:\n\nBUG A — Unsaved edits silently dropped:\nscheduleAutoSave has saveTask?.cancel() BELOW an early-return guard. When a new note is loaded, editorContent == originalContent (both set to the new note's content), so the guard returns early and the old save task is NEVER cancelled. The old task fires, reads current state (now pointing at note B), and saves B's content to B's URL — a harmless duplicate write. But note A's edits were never saved anywhere. The isDirty flag is reset to false by loadSelectedNote, hiding the data loss.\n\nRoot cause: saveTask?.cancel() at L987 is unreachable when the guard at L981 returns early.\n\nCode flow:\n1. User edits note A → scheduleAutoSave creates saveTask T1 (500ms delay)\n2. User switches to B within 500ms → loadSelectedNote sets editorContent = B, originalContent = B\n3. onChange(editorContent) fires → scheduleAutoSave → guard (B == B) → returns early\n4. saveTask?.cancel() at L987 is NEVER reached — T1 still pending\n5. T1 fires → performSave reads selectedNoteID=B, editorContent=B → saves B to B's URL\n6. Note A's edits are LOST — no save, no warning\n\nBUG B — Wrong-file write potential:\nIf note B is edited before T1 fires, editorContent would differ from originalContent, and scheduleAutoSave would cancel T1 and create T2. But in the narrow window where the user switches without editing B, T1 writes B's already-saved content to B's URL (wasteful but not destructive).\n\nLocation: ContentView.swift L979-993 (scheduleAutoSave), L995-1023 (performSave), L789-837 (loadSelectedNote)\n\nFix — must address BOTH bugs:\n1. Move saveTask?.cancel() ABOVE the early-return guard in scheduleAutoSave, so the old task is always cancelled on any editor content change:\n```swift\nprivate func scheduleAutoSave() {\n    guard let selectedID = selectedNoteID else { return }\n    saveTask?.cancel()  // ← moved up: always cancel pending save\n    guard editorContent != originalContent else {\n        isDirty = false\n        return\n    }\n    isDirty = true\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n2. In loadSelectedNote, force-save dirty content before loading new note:\n```swift\nprivate func loadSelectedNote(id: UUID?) {\n    if isDirty, let currentID = selectedNoteID {\n        saveTask?.cancel()\n        Task { await performSave() }  // save current note first\n    }\n    // ... load new note\n}\n```\n\n3. Capture note identity at scheduling time as a defense-in-depth measure (original fix from the plan):\n```swift\nlet capturedID = selectedNoteID\nlet capturedContent = editorContent\nsaveTask = Task {\n    try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(500))\n    guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }\n    guard selectedNoteID == capturedID else { return }\n    await performSave(id: capturedID!, content: capturedContent)\n}\n```\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] saveTask?.cancel() is always reached when editorContent changes (moved above guard)\n- [ ] loadSelectedNote force-saves dirty content before switching to new note\n- [ ] scheduleAutoSave captures note identity at scheduling time as defense-in-depth\n- [ ] performSave validates target note hasn't changed before writing\n- [ ] Switching notes rapidly does not lose unsaved edits from the previous note\n- [ ] Switching notes rapidly does not write content to the wrong file\n- [ ] Build succeeds: xcodebuild -scheme NeoNV -destination 'platform=macOS' build\n\nReference: docs/plans/file-safety-audit.md Finding 3 (corrected and expanded)","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"mds@area51a.net","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:28:04.846585-08:00","created_by":"Matt S.","updated_at":"2026-02-06T17:22:24.206599-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T17:22:24.206599-08:00","close_reason":"PR merged: fix autosave writing to wrong file after note selection change"}

Then moveItem fails with \"file already exists\", the error bubbles up to the save error dialog, and the user's edit appears unsaved. The temp file (.filename.tmp) is also leaked on disk.\n\nFix:\n1. Remove the fileExists check entirely — use replaceItemAt unconditionally, which handles both existing and non-existing destinations on modern macOS\n2. If replaceItemAt cannot handle the \"file doesn't exist\" case reliably, catch the moveItem error and fall back to replaceItemAt\n3. Wrap temp file cleanup in a defer block (overlaps with neonv-ea9)\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- [ ] atomicWrite does not use a fileExists pre-check before write operations\n- [ ] Both the \"new file\" and \"existing file\" cases work correctly without TOCTOU window\n- [ ] Temp file is cleaned up on failure via defer\n- [ ] Build succeeds: xcodebuild -scheme NeoNV -destination 'platform=macOS' build\n\nContext: Discovered during file safety audit.
