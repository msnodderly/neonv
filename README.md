# NeoNV

A fast, frictionless text capture tool for macOS. Store snippets, thoughts, notes, and random text without friction. Find them instantly. Never think about saving.

Inspired by [Notational Velocity](https://notational.net/)'s legendary speed and simplicity, built native for modern macOS.

## Philosophy

**Do one thing perfectly:** Capture and retrieve text instantly.

This is not a note-taking system. Not a knowledge base. Not a productivity tool. It's a place to put text so you can find it later.

## Features

- **Instant Capture** — One text box, always ready. Auto-saves continuously.
- **Instant Search** — Fuzzy full-text search as you type. Results appear immediately.
- **Zero Friction Storage** — Point at any folder. Files are plain `.txt`, `.md`, or `.org`. No database, no lock-in.
- **Native Performance** — macOS-native Swift/SwiftUI. Optimized for Apple Silicon. Instant everything.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac (universal binary)

## Building
